Currently there is a error in cell 10 
Also There has to be a dataset provided 
Forked from
https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/dev/scripts/torch/train.py

Apparently to load MNSIT dataset from keras I need tensorflow installed, I guess 
we cannot escape tf #Not using MNSIT anymore so no need
New error in file VoxelMoprh_Tutorial_torch.ipynb in cell 16, I have sucessfully created
the pytorch model now there is an issue with the input in the traning the cell


Two fuctions need to be re-worked 
1. def vxm_data_generator(x_data, batch_size=32):
2. def conform(x, in_shape = (256,) * 2):
as they are in compatilbe with pytorch
