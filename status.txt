Currently there is a error in cell 10 
Also There has to be a dataset provided 
Forked from
https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/dev/scripts/torch/train.py

Apparently to load MNSIT dataset from keras I need tensorflow installed, I guess 
we cannot escape tf #Not using MNSIT anymore so no need
New error in file VoxelMoprh_Tutorial_torch.ipynb in cell 16, I have sucessfully created
the pytorch model now there is an issue with the input in the traning the cell
