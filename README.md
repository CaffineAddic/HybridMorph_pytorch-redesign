# HybridMorph_pytorch-redesign
#### This is a rework of HybridMorph using pytorch 
Due to multiple errors caused by tensorflow versions, this is a reimplimentation of the voxelmorph tutorial instead of tensorflow, *pytorch* is used.
This research project to see the effect of training on hybrid dataset (real + artifical MR images) on the regestration process to make it invarinat of image intensity and allow it to train better on little or none real medical datasets.
